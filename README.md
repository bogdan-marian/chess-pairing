# chess-paring
Hello everyone.
In this project I’m hoping to create a simple to use project that can be used in paring chess players on chess tournaments. I intend to make this project as portable as possible so it can be used in mobile devices and cloud applications. 

First mile stone it will be to implement a functional and approved algorithm. The starting point will be to adapt javaparing project. I’m currently hoping to decuple one algorithm from the GUI. It will be quite a challenge. If anyone interested to help me please do not hesitate to drop me a message.
